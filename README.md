This CMS is created to make blogging easier for everyone. You can manage your posts, create categories, manage comments, create users and edit your profile. It makes use of the API called Faker in which you can story dummy data inside the database. Also it secure in terms of SQL-injections and Cross Site Scripting, so no worries! What is also possible is that you can Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) the data inside tables. You can approve particular comments to make them display on the website.
