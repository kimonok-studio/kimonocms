A Content Managment System (CMS) Created In PHP.

-- Kimono きもの CMS --
This CMS is created to make blogging easier for everyone. You can manage your posts, create categories, manage comments, create users and edit your profile. It makes use of the API called Faker in which you can story dummy inside the database. Also it secure in terms of SQL-injections and Cross Site Scripting, so no worries! What is also possible is can Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) the data inside tables. You can approve particular comments to make them display on the website. However, the registration page is not secure yet. We need a fix to approve the registration first. Now it is the case that everyone can create an account and manipulate all the data.
